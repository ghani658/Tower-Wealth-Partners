										<p><span>† The Forbes ranking of Best-In-State Wealth Advisors, developed by SHOOK Research, is based on an algorithm of qualitative criteria, mostly gained through telephone and in-person due diligence interviews, and quantitative data. Those advisors that are considered have a minimum of seven years of experience, and the algorithm weights factors like revenue trends, assets under management, compliance records, industry experience and those that encompass best practices in their practices and approach to working with clients. Portfolio performance is not a criteria due to varying client objectives and lack of audited data. Out of approximately 32,000 nominations, more than 4,000 advisors received the award. This ranking is not indicative of advisor’s future performance, is not an endorsement, and may not be representative of individual clients’ experience. Neither Raymond James nor any of its Financial Advisors or RIA firms pay a fee in exchange for this award/rating. Raymond James is not affiliated with Forbes or Shook Research, LLC.

									<p><span>† The Forbes ranking of Best-In-State Wealth Advisors, developed by SHOOK Research, is based on an algorithm of qualitative criteria, mostly gained through telephone and in-person due diligence interviews, and quantitative data. Those advisors that are considered have a minimum of seven years of experience, and the algorithm weights factors like revenue trends, assets under management, compliance records, industry experience and those that encompass best practices in their practices and approach to working with clients. Portfolio performance is not a criteria due to varying client objectives and lack of audited data. Out of approximately 32,000 nominations, more than 4,000 advisors received the award. This ranking is not indicative of advisor’s future performance, is not an endorsement, and may not be representative of individual clients’ experience. Neither Raymond James nor any of its Financial Advisors or RIA firms pay a fee in exchange for this award/rating. Raymond James is not affiliated with Forbes or Shook Research, LLC.

Your financial goals may evolve over the years due to shifts in your lifestyle or circumstances such as an inheritance, career change, marriage, house purchase or a growing family. As you begin to consider how best to manage your financial future, you should feel confident knowing that with a CFP® professional, you’re working with someone committed to providing the high standardzzz of financial planning.</p>

										<p class="mb-4"><img src="assets/images/CIMA-logo.png"> There are hundreds of credentials in the financial services marketplace—with varying degrees of credibility— creating an alphabet soup of convoluted acronyms and information overload. So why should you work with a CIMA professional? Not all financial credentials are created equal, and very few meet the high standards of being accredited by a third party.</p>
										<p>The Certified Investment Management Analyst. (CIMAss) certification demonstrates that individuals have completed and adhered to the "four Es": experience, education, examination and ethics. In order to earn CIMA certification, candidates must</p>
										<ul class="mb-3">
											<li>Demonstrate at least three years of broad experience in the field of investment management consulting or financial services by the completion of certification.</li>
											<li>Pass an extensive background check and qualification examination.</li>
											<li>Complete an education program at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, or The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.</li>
											<li>Successfully pass a comprehensive certification examination.</li>
											<li>Agree to adhere to an ethical code of professional responsibility and to complete 40 hours of continuing education every two years, including two hours of ethics continuing education.</li>
